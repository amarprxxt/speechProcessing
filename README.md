**MATLAB Speech Processing Project**

This repository contains a MATLAB based project that demonstrates basic audio signal processing techniques such as signal plotting, echo addition, amplitude conditioning, and playback. It's a beginner-friendly exploration of speech/audio manipulation using MATLAB's powerful built-in functions.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to:
- Load and visualize audio signals in the time domain.
- Play back audio at different sampling rates.
- Add artificial echoes to simulate environmental effects.
- Limit signal amplitude to reduce clipping and distortion.
- Provide a base for exploring more advanced speech/audio processing concepts.

**Features**

- Time-domain signal visualization using `plot`
- Audio playback with modified sampling rates
- Echo simulation by shifting and layering the original signal
- Amplitude limiting for dynamic range control
- Compatible with `.wav` audio files


**File Structure**

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `speech_processing.m` | Main MATLAB script |
| `your_audio.wav` | Sample `.wav` file (you can replace it with your own) |


**How to Run**

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Open MATLAB** and navigate to the project directory.
3. Replace `'your_audio.wav'` in the code with the name of your own `.wav` file if needed.
4. Run the script:
